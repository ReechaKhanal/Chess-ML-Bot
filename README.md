# Chess-ML-Bot

#### I am an Amateur Chess Player and Pro Chess Lover. Aim of this application is to create a chess application that mimics my chess moves and plays like me.

### Data:

  Raw Data: The Raw Data I am using is my games data, in .pgn format, downloaded from lichess.org
  
  It all starts with manipulating this Raw Data to a Normalized form (as a csv file).
  
  *NormalizeData.py*
    
      - file does this conversion, and additional data cleaning for us
      - This file is accessed from the main.py
